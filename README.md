# Supabase+Wordpress+Vite+API-Server Docker Compose Setup

This repository provides a Docker Compose file for setting up a local Supabase development environment. It includes all the necessary services, configured for easy deployment and testing.  This setup also includes a WordPress instance with a custom plugin and phpMyAdmin for database management.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.  See the official Docker documentation for installation instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A `.env` file in the root directory containing the required environment variables.  A sample `.env` file is provided below.
- A `supabase` directory with the necessary configuration files and volumes as described in the original docker-compose file. This directory is not included in the repository for security reasons and should be created manually.
- A `wp-plugin` directory containing your custom WordPress plugin. This directory is not included in the repository and should be created manually.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Create the `.env` file:**

   Copy the example `.env.example` content below and create a `.env` file in the root directory.  **Fill in the placeholder values with your actual credentials.**

  ```

3. **Create the `supabase` directory:**

   Create the `supabase` directory and populate it with the necessary files and subdirectories as described in the original docker-compose file.  This includes creating the `volumes` subdirectories and populating them with the SQL scripts, Kong configuration, and other required files.  This step is crucial for the Supabase setup to function correctly.

4. **Create the `wp-plugin` directory:**

   Create the `wp-plugin` directory and place your custom WordPress plugin inside.  This directory should contain your plugin's files and folders.

5. **Start the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. **Access the services:**

   - Supabase Studio: `http://localhost:8000` (Use the credentials from your `.env` file)
   - WordPress: `http://localhost:8090`
   - phpMyAdmin: `http://localhost:8091`
   - Dashboard UI: `http://localhost:8092` (Example vite app)
   - Iframes: `http://localhost:8093` (Example vite app)
   - API: `http://localhost:8095` (Example JS Server)

7. **Stop the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

## Important Notes

- This setup is for development purposes only.  Do not use it in production.
- Make sure to replace all placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual credentials.
- The `supabase` directory and `wp-plugin` directory are not included in the repository and must be created manually.  Refer to the original docker-compose file for the directory structure and required files.
- The WordPress setup includes a custom plugin.  Make sure to place your plugin in the `wp-plugin` directory.
- The database credentials for WordPress are defined in the `.env` file.
- The provided `.env` file is a template.  You may need to adjust it based on your specific needs.
- The `supavisor` service is included for connection pooling.  This can improve performance, especially under heavy load.
- The included WordPress setup uses MySQL.
- The `vector` service is used for log aggregation.
- The `imgproxy` service is used for image processing.
